        <h1>Aria and how to get started</h1>

        <p>
          Aria is a large topic and it can be overwhelming to get started, this
          post will cover:
        </p>

        <nav id="secondary-navigation">
          <ul class="styled-list">
            <li>
              <a href="#getting-started">how to get started</a>

            <li>
              <a href="">when to use them</a>

            <h3>When should you use aria?</h3>
            <p>
              A great starting point for expanding your accessibility skills is
              to learn{' '}
              <em>when</em> and <em>how</em> to use aria.
            </p>

            <p>
              Usually all of the problems are caused by us the developer, these
              may include:
            </p>
            <ul class="styled-list">
              <li class="dot-points">Accessibility</li>
              <li class="dot-points">
                Responsiveness at different screen sizes
              </li>
              <li class="dot-points">
                Sites that can't be used without Javascript
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              All of the HTML elements that are available to a developer come
              with specific roles (and other features) baked into them. A div
              element does not naturally come with an onClick, and it wouldn't
              normally be focusable.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through the use of Javascript we tend to 'fix' these problems
              (because we can) and move on.

            <h3 class="text-center">General Rules</h3>

            <h4 class="numbered-title">
              <span role="presentation">1</span> Complexity can be confusing
            </h4>

            <p>
              When / if you write <span>complex logic with Javascript</span>,
              hide things with CSS, add extra abilities to HTML elements (i.e.
              add focusability to a div) it will probably be appropriate to add
              an aria-role to clarify the intent of the component.
            </p>

            <p>
              ARIA, by design, has no effect on how elements are displayed or
              behave in browsers. It does not add new functionality and is meant
              to act only as an extra descriptive layer for screen readers
            </p>

            <h4 class="numbered-title">
              <span role="presentation">2</span> Semantic / Correct HTML conveys
              how to use the website properly.
            </h4>
            <p>
              A website without any CSS or javascript is probably going to be
              99% responsive, and if we made sure to only use Semantic markup it
              would probably be Accessible to 99.99% of people.
